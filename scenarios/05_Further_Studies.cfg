At first they only got to know each other during meals, but their friendship grew and they spent more time with each other. Elania had a very peaceful temperment and would often try to disuade Vallin from his occassional bouts with anger. Vallin appreciated her spirit and her kindness. After some time, he did not think that he could have coped at the guild without her."

One day he got in a heated argument with another classmate. Still fuming, he snuck down into the caves at night, not caring at the time for the rules that had been put in place."
