The tower was constructed on a magical fount of energy, deep in the caves beneath the hills. A mage guild was started there, much smaller that the Great Academy, but due to the proximity of the caves, it was said mages advanced in power much faster and mages from the guild began to be known for their great battle presence.")}
        {MAP_OASTRAM_START (_ "Many years later, by 275 YW, during the Golden Age of Wesnoth, many villages had been built surrounding Eiyar due to the protection that was gained from being in close proximity to the tower. However, it was not uncommon of evidence of the use of dark magics and sightings of undead were not as infrequent as other parts of the realm.
            
To the south of the tower, lies the small village of Oastram, where we find our story.")}
